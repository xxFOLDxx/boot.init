What is boot.init?
boot.init is a Linux boot automation toolkit. It helps you define what should happen when the system boots, how services start, and how tasks run at startup. It bridges gaps between different boot environments, including systemd, traditional init, and layered startup scripts. It aims to be simple to install, easy to configure, and resilient to common boot-time failures.

Why boot.init matters
Boot time is critical. A reliable boot sequence reduces downtime, speeds up system readiness, and makes maintenance easier. When you manage multiple machines or complex setups, a consistent boot workflow matters even more. boot.init provides a clear way to declare boot tasks, their order, and their dependencies. It helps you automate routine boot chores, recover gracefully from partial failures, and keep your systems predictable.

Core goals and design principles
- Clarity: Clear, explicit boot tasks that are easy to read and modify.
- Consistency: A predictable startup order across different Linux environments.
- Extensibility: Simple hooks and extension points for scripts and tools.
- Portability: Works with bash, sh, fish, and other shells commonly found in boot environments.
- Safety by design: Tasks run with controlled privileges and explicit error handling.
- Observability: Clear logs and status reporting during and after boot.

Features at a glance

How boot.init fits with Linux boot flows
Linux boots through a series of stages. In many systems, systemd handles unit lifecycles. In others, traditional init or core scripts initiate startup. boot.init acts as a layer above these mechanisms to define and orchestrate tasks you want run at boot. It can trigger scripts, launch services, and orchestrate tasks in a controlled sequence. When systemd is present, boot.init can collaborate with systemd units to ensure tasks run at the right time. When systemd is absent or minimal, boot.init provides a robust alternative for boot orchestration.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: A Linux system with a bash-compatible shell. You should have root access or sudo privileges to install boot.init and modify boot configurations.
- Goals: Install boot.init, define a boot workflow, test the workflow, and enable it to run on every boot.
- What you’ll learn: How to declare boot tasks, how to sequence tasks, how to handle failures, and how to integrate with systemd or legacy init.

Quick start guide
1) Prepare your system
- Ensure you have a stable shell environment (bash or sh).
- Check that you have sudo privileges for system changes.
- Confirm the system can reach the internet if you rely on remote scripts during boot.

2) Install boot.init
- Visit the releases page to obtain the installer package.
- From the Releases page, download the installer boot.init-installer.sh and grant execution permission, then run it to install boot.init. The installer will set up the core components and place default configuration templates. The installer script should be executed with proper privileges to write to system directories.

3) Define a simple boot task
- Create a minimal boot.init configuration that runs a script at boot. For example, declare a task named initialize-wifi to bring up a network interface, or a task to mount a diagnostics partition.
- Place the configuration in the boot.init configuration directory and ensure it is readable by the boot process.

4) Test the boot sequence
- Run boot.init in a dry-run mode if supported, or trigger the boot sequence manually to verify that tasks execute in the intended order.
- Review log output to confirm each task starts and finishes as expected.

5) Enable at every boot
- Enable the boot.init workflow in the system’s startup routines. On systems with systemd, this often means enabling a service or timer. On traditional Init systems, ensure the init scripts are linked to the proper runlevel directories.

6) Observe and refine
- Reboot the system and observe the boot sequence. Make adjustments to task ordering, dependencies, and failure handling as needed.

Installation and installer details
- The installation process is designed to be straightforward. The installer script boot.init-installer.sh should be downloaded from the releases page and executed with appropriate permissions.
- After installation, boot.init places its runtime files in a dedicated directory under /usr/local/lib/boot.init or an equivalent path chosen by the installer. You will find configuration templates in /etc/boot.init or a similar location.
- The installer creates a startup entry so boot.init launches automatically at boot. It also installs a minimal log facility to help you monitor boot-time actions.

Configuration and tuning
- Configuration format: boot.init uses a clear, text-based syntax. Each boot task has a name, a command or script to run, a time window or phase in the boot sequence, and dependencies on other tasks.
- Key fields include:
  - name: A unique identifier for the task.
  - run: The command or script to execute.
  - when: The phase in the boot sequence (early, middle, late).
  - depends_on: A list of tasks that must finish before this one runs.
  - user: The user to run under (optional).
  - env: Environment variables for the task (optional).
- Example:
  - name: mount-sysfs
  - run: mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
  - when: early
  - depends_on: []
- You can extend configuration with conditional logic, basic error handling, and simple retry strategies. Each task can define a maximum retry count and a backoff strategy to handle transient failures.

Commands and workflows
- boot.init start: Start the boot initialization sequence manually. Useful for debugging boot tasks without rebooting.
- boot.init stop: Stop the boot sequence gracefully. Useful when you need to pause the boot flow to fix a misconfiguration.
- boot.init status: Show the current status of all registered boot tasks. This helps you track progress and identify bottlenecks.
- boot.init log: View the boot-time logs. The log shows timestamps, task names, and outcomes (success, failure, skipped).
- boot.init reconfigure: Reload the configuration files without a full restart. This helps when making live changes.
- boot.init test: Run a test scenario that exercises a subset of tasks. This is useful for development and QA.

Examples and recipes
- Example 1: Simple service startup
  - Task to start a web server after the network is up.
  - Dependencies: network-online
  - Command: /usr/local/bin/start-my-web-app
- Example 2: Desktop readiness
  - Tasks to prepare the user environment after system services start.
  - Steps include mounting a user storage drive and starting a background wallpaper manager.
- Example 3: Rebuild and verify partitions
  - A recovery-oriented boot path to verify partitions and perform filesystem checks.

Advanced usage
- Conditional boot paths: Create tasks that run only if certain conditions exist, such as a specific hardware present or a particular file system mounted.
- Parallel task execution: Identify independent tasks that can run in parallel to speed up boot time.
- Retry policies: Implement a small backoff loop for tasks that may fail due to temporary conditions.

Desktop and server use cases
- Desktop: Prioritize user environment readiness, display manager startup, and background services that enhance user experience.
- Server: Focus on network readiness, logging, monitoring agents, and essential services that keep the system reachable and observable.
- Hybrid environments: Use boot.init to coordinate both system services and desktop components during boot to ensure a coherent startup experience.

Scripting and shells
- Boot tasks usually run with bash or sh. You can write script blocks in Bash to implement logic, error handling, and environment preparation.
- Consider writing portable scripts that avoid relying on features specific to a single shell. The configuration can point to shell scripts that remain portable.

Cron and timed actions
- boot.init can incorporate timed actions that resemble cron jobs but run at boot. For example, a task that schedules a daily backup after boot or a timed health check a few minutes after the system is ready.
- Use the when field to place timed actions into the boot sequence, ensuring they don’t run too early or too late.

Integration with Fish and Bash
- The project supports common shells used in boot contexts. You can specify shell-specific scripts for tasks that require shell features.
- For Fish users, you can provide a fish script as the run command or have a small wrapper that calls Fish with your script.

Systemd compatibility and workarounds
- boot.init can cooperate with systemd by issuing workflows that align with unit startup. It can trigger systemd units, monitor their status, and react to failures.
- In environments without full systemd support, boot.init handles init-style workflows through traditional init scripts or rc.d style structures.
- The goal is to keep boot-time automation consistent across environments with minimal surprises.

Debugging and troubleshooting
- Start with the status and log commands to identify where a boot task might fail.
- Use verbose logging for detailed output during debugging.
- Validate dependencies and the order of execution to ensure a clean startup sequence.
- Check permissions and paths for scripts and binaries used by boot.init.
- Confirm that the boot-time environment matches the expected environment used during development.

Security and safety notes
- Boot tasks run with elevated privileges in many setups. Keep scripts simple and avoid risky operations during boot.
- Use explicit paths to binaries to avoid path ambiguity in the restricted boot environment.
- Keep sensitive data out of logs and config files where possible, or implement proper access controls on configuration artifacts.
- Validate scripts before enabling them in the boot sequence to reduce the risk of unintended side effects during startup.

Extending boot.init
- Create new task modules that extend the core functionality. Modules can provide additional hooks, new task types, or specialized behaviors for different hardware or environments.
- Create custom triggers, such as responding to specific hardware events or file system changes during boot.
- Add support for more shells, more robust environment handling, and richer error handling.

Development workflow
- Clone the repository and set up a development environment with the necessary tooling.
- Run unit tests and integration tests that cover common boot scenarios.
- Practice a clean development cycle: code, test, document, and review.
- Keep changes backward compatible where possible to minimize disruption for users upgrading.

Testing
- Use a dedicated test environment that mirrors production boot conditions.
- Validate task ordering, parallelism, and failure handling under varied conditions.
- Test across different Linux distributions to ensure broad compatibility.
- Include a mix of systemd-enabled and legacy init environments in tests.

Usage patterns and best practices
- Start simple: Define a small set of boot tasks first. Test their order and behavior before adding more tasks.
- Keep tasks focused: Each task should do one job with a clear purpose. This makes debugging easier.
- Document tasks: Add comments to your configuration so future you understands why a task exists and how it should behave.
- Avoid long-running tasks at boot: If a task takes a long time, consider scheduling it after the system is up or using a background service.
- Use dependencies: Always declare dependencies to ensure tasks run in the proper order.
- Monitor health: Set up status reporting and logs so you can monitor boot health after deployment.
- Plan rollbacks: If a boot change causes issues, have a rollback plan to restore a known-good configuration quickly.

Tips for administrators
- Use tiny, deterministic scripts: Small scripts with explicit outputs reduce guesswork during troubleshooting.
- Keep a separate boot.log: A dedicated log for boot tasks helps isolate boot-time issues from regular system logs.
- Test on snapshots: Use system snapshots or containers to reproduce boot scenarios safely without affecting your production systems.
- Maintain upgrade paths: When updating boot.init, ensure existing configurations remain valid or provide migration notes.
